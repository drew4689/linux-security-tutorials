//ST: 'Escape' or 'o' to see all sides, F11 for full screen, 's' for speaker notes

//ST: !
==== What?

- Debian jessie 8.7
- vi

-> change for your favorite text editor, and probably valid for Ubuntu as well.

//ST: !
==== Make sure you have the latest version of all packages:

 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

//ST: !
==== Network Time Protocol

 aptitude install ntp

Then define your time zone (the one where your server is located):

 dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

//ST: !
==== harden the kernel
 vi /etc/sysctl.d/local.conf

 - Paste the contents of link:resources/kernel_config.txt[this file]:
 - Close the file
 - reboot the server

//ST: !
==== changing SSH port
 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Text to change in the file:

- change port SSH 22 by a new port (*let's say 1234*), write the new port down somewhere
- ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
- UsePAM no

 service sshd restart

//ST: !
==== Installing the sudo command:

 apt-get install sudo

//ST: !
==== Adding a new user (let's call it "myUser")

  adduser myUser

//ST: !
==== Enabling server connections via myUser

 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

AllowUsers myUser

Then restart the SSH service:

  service sshd restart

//ST: !
====  Disabling connection through root

  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Text to change in the file:

 PermitRootLogin no

From there on, you cannot login to the server from root, only from myUser.

To switch to root privileges:

  su -

//ST: !
==== enable SSH key auth

- Generate a key with puttygen (SSH-2 RSA 1024).
- Parameters to change in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

X11Forwarding no

UsePAM no

//ST: !
LogLevel DEBUG3 (this should be added, the parameter is not listed by default)

- Save the file, then:

 service sshd restart

- Add your public key to `/home/myUser/.ssd/authorized_keys`

//ST: !
Make sure that:

- you have put the keys in `/home/myUser/.ssd/authorized_keys` (not just in the root user folder)
- your key starts with "the "ssh-rsa" (the first "s" might be missing ...)
- the key doesn't break in several lines
- do `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` on the home folder
- use  `tail -f /var/log/auth.log` for debugging

//ST: !
When SSH key login works, go back to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and do:

PasswordAuthentication no

then:  `service sshd restart`

//ST: !
Things will not work the first time, useful tips:

//ST: !
==== installing the undifficult firewall

 sudo apt-get update

 apt-get install ufw

//ST: !
==== denying all incoming traffic except for SSH port

 ufw default deny incoming

 sudo ufw allow 1234/tcp

 ufw enable

//ST: !
==== install and config of Psad

First, making sure the firewall logs the traffic:

 iptables -A INPUT -j LOG
 iptables -A FORWARD -j LOG

 apt-get install psad

//ST: !
Then modify some options in the config file, which is situated here:

 vi /etc/psad/psad.conf

Here are some options I modified: link:resources/psad-config.txt[my psad config file]

//ST: !
Then we whitelist our own server:

 vi /etc/psad/auto_dl

where I put just 2 values:

127.0.0.1    0;  # localhost

xx.xx.xxx.xxx    0; # Server IP (replace xx.xx.xxx.xxx by your actual server IP)

//ST: !
==== to be continued


//ST: !
== the end
//ST: The end!

//ST: !
