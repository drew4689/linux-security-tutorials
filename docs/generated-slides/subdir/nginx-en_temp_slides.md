When I was introduced to nginx a long time ago, it was as a convenient replacement for Apache Web Server: lighter, faster.

Indeed, nginx can help you direct the traffic received by your domain www.example.com to the html / php / js files or Java apps sitting on your server.

==  !
But it can do more than being a web server.
Nginx is a "reverse proxy", quite a barbaric term.
I'd describe it as *a tool doing useful stuff between your firewall and your web app*. For security, it helps you with:

==  !

- dealing with SSL certificates
- help you mitigate DDOS attacks, and generally, controlling traffic in an easier way than using iptables
- hide the server from view


==  !
So I suppose you could do much of what nginx does via iptable and whatever app server you use, but concentring stuff in nginx makes it easier.

Why a tutorial specifically on nginx used for a glassfish app with ssl certificates?

- this is my personal use case
- there are no tutorials on it, though https://gist.github.com/halid/8fe138babedcb280c784[this file on github] does 99% of the job (and we'll use it here).

==  !
So, this tutorial assumes you have created certificates with letsencrypt's certbot, as explained in a previous tutorial.

Let's start:

==  !

 apt-get install nginx

 vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/yourdomain.com.conf

(note: the ".conf" extension is necessary for the file to be loaded in nginx)

Paste the content of https://gist.github.com/halid/8fe138babedcb280c784[this file] in yourdomain.com.conf.

==  !
Explanations on the lines of this file:

==  !
[source,nginx]
-------------------------------
upstream glassfish_server {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080 fail_timeout=0;
    }
-------------------------------

This tells on which port the glassfish server can be reached.
Remember that the default port 8080 can be changed to a more random port.
See the glassfish installation guide in the same series of tutorials.

==  !
[source,nginx]
-------------------------------
    server {
           listen         80;
           server_name    berat.com;
           return         301 https://$server_name$request_uri;<1>
    }
-------------------------------

<1> This means you can still be contacted through *http*, it will simply be redirected to *https*. Nice!

==  !
[source,nginx]
-------------------------------
 ssl_certificate /var/certs/server.crt;
 ssl_certificate_key /var/certs/server.key;
-------------------------------

For a ssl certificate created with letsencrypt, these lines should be changed for:

- ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/cert.pem;
- ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

==  !
That's it. Restart nginx to load your config:

/etc/init.d/nginx restart

Make sure the port 443 is open in your firewall.

==  !

Test your domain can be reached with SSL, with https and a nice green OK in the url bar: https://yourdomain.com

(don't write https://yourdomain.com:8080, it's silly but it blocked me a long time...)
